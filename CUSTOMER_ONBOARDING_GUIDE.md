## 🎯 Study Mode Walkthrough

### Step 1: Review Flashcards
When you create a set, it automatically opens Study Mode:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Q: What is X?     │  ← Question side
└─────────────────────┘
     [Show Answer]  ← Click to flip
```

Click "Show Answer" to see the answer.

### Step 2: Rate Each Card
After seeing the answer, rate how well you knew it:

- **❌ Bad** (Red) - I didn't know this
- **😐 OK** (Yellow) - I kinda knew it
- **✅ Good** (Green) - I knew it well

→ Card highlights in that color so you remember

### Step 3: Review Summary
After rating all cards:

```
✅ Mastered: 5 cards (green)
😐 Medium: 3 cards (yellow)
❌ Weak: 2 cards (red)
```

You can:
- "Review weak cards first" - focus on what you don't know
- "Continue to test" - take a quiz
