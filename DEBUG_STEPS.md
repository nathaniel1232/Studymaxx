# Debug Steps - Run These in Browser Console

Open your browser console (F12) and run these commands **one by one**. Send me the output.

## Quick Test - Check What's Happening
```javascript
// This will show you the auth state
console.log('Page loaded. Check console for [CreateFlowView] or [InputView] messages')
```

## Manual Premium Check (if needed)
If you don't see Premium working, trigger a manual check:
```javascript
// Force a page reload to re-check session
location.reload()
```
