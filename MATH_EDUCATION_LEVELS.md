## Key Calibration Rules for the AI Tutor

1. **Never introduce notation the student hasn't seen.** If a middle schooler asks about area, don't use integral signs. If a grade 10 student asks about exponential growth, don't use limits.

2. **Match explanation depth to level.** Middle school: show every step. High school: explain reasoning. University: state the theorem, apply it, note edge cases.

3. **Word problem context should be age-appropriate.** Middle school: candy, sports, simple shopping. High school: driving, part-time jobs, science contexts. University: physics, engineering, economics, abstract.

4. **When a student asks about a topic above their level**, acknowledge it briefly and redirect: "That's a great question that you'll explore in [next level]. For now, let's focus on [current topic]."

5. **Calculator assumptions by level:**
   - Middle school: Basic calculator or none
   - High school: Scientific calculator (TI-30/Casio fx)
   - Norwegian upper secondary: CAS calculator (TI-Nspire CX CAS, Casio ClassPad) and GeoGebra
   - University: Varies — sometimes no calculator on exams, sometimes graphing calculator, sometimes computer algebra systems

6. **Proof expectations by level:**
   - Middle school: None — explain with examples
   - High school: Informal reasoning, geometric proofs (two-column or paragraph)
   - Pre-university (R2/AP): Direct proof, proof by contradiction (basic)
   - University: Formal proofs expected — induction, epsilon-delta, contradiction, contrapositive

7. **Error tolerance:** At lower levels, partial credit and "close enough" reasoning should be encouraged. At university level, precision matters — a missing absolute value or domain restriction should be flagged.

## Difficulty Scaling: Same Topic Across Levels

### Example: "Solving Equations"

| Level | What This Looks Like |
|---|---|
| **Middle School** | 3x + 5 = 20 → one-step/two-step, integer solutions |
| **High School** | x² − 5x + 6 = 0 → factoring, quadratic formula |
| **Pre-University** | 2sin(x) = √3 for x ∈ [0, 2π] → trig equations; eˣ = 5 → logarithmic equations |
| **University** | dy/dx = xy, y(0)=1 → separable ODE; Ax = b → matrix equation in linear algebra |

### Example: "Working with Functions"

| Level | What This Looks Like |
|---|---|
| **Middle School** | Input/output tables, "what's the rule?", y = 2x + 3 |
| **High School** | f(x) = x² − 4, find zeros, vertex, graph; f(x) = 2ˣ growth model |
| **Pre-University** | f(x) = ln(x²+1), find f'(x), critical points, inflection points, graph fully |
| **University** | f: ℝⁿ → ℝᵐ, analyze as linear transformation; prove f is continuous at a point using ε-δ |

### Example: "Probability"

| Level | What This Looks Like |
|---|---|
| **Middle School** | "What's the probability of rolling a 3 on a die?" — single event, counting |
| **High School** | "P(A and B) if independent" — multiplication rule, permutations/combinations |
| **Pre-University** | "X ~ Bin(10, 0.3), find P(X ≥ 3)" — distribution calculations, expected value |
| **University** | "Derive the MLE for λ in Poisson(λ)" — mathematical statistics, proofs |
